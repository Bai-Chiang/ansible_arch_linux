This repository is a collection of Ansible roles that I used to provision __all__ of my machines, from laptop to servers.

It also has an `arch_install.sh` script, that installs Archlinux.
The goal of this script is to set up a basic environment, then let Ansible playbooks take care of remaining configurations.
